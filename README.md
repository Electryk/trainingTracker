# Training Tracker

## Start using this App

Assuming you already have [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html) installed, you must fork this repo. After that, you have to clone your forked repo on your local machine on the directory you desire: `git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/trainingTracker`.

In order to check that everything is working well, you can execute the commands `gradle build` or `gradle check`.

## Build & Run

To run the application you only need to use the following commands:

- **jettyRun** - Deploys a Jetty server in http://localhost:8080, using the files located on the project's source directory.
This allows to modify any of these files and be able to see the changes in hot. Beware! If we modify any .java file, 
we will hace to compile them again on another terminal with 'gradle classes'.

- **jettyWar** - Deploys a Jetty server in http://localhost:8080, using the .war file generated by the project. With this option
we won't be able to see any modification in hot, but in exachange it'll allow us to test the .war after the compiling and 
packaging process.

- **jettyStop** - Stops the Jetty server, if any deployed. It's necessary to execute this command in a different terminal in which
'jettyRun' or 'jettyRunWar' were executed, unless they were executed in background with '&'.

## Test

Gradle allows you to run the tests defined on src/test with `gradle test`.
