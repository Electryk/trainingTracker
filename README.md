jettyRun - Deploys a Jetty server in http://localhost:8080, using the files located on the project's source directory.
This allows to modify any of these files and be able to see the changes in hot. Â¡Beware! If we modify any .java file, 
we will hace to compile them again on another terminal with 'gradle classes'.
